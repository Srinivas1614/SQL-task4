In this task, we learn how to back up and restore a database to prevent data loss.
Step 1: Use mysqldump (for MySQL) or pg_dump (for PostgreSQL) to create a backup file.
Step 2: Store the backup file securely to ensure data recovery in case of failure.
Step 3: If data is lost or corrupted, recreate the database and restore it using mysql or pg_restore.
Step 4: Verify that all data has been successfully restored by checking tables and row counts.
This ensures data safety and business continuity in case of unexpected failures.
